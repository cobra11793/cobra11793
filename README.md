- 👋 Hi, I’m Varoujan!
- 👀 I’m interested in mobile/web development! I also have interests in boardgames, video games, and sports!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Android studio, MERN stack, LAMP(for security/firewall purposes), and CSS animations(they're too cool not to try to learn).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that give me an opportunity to learn something new.
- 📫 How to reach me
